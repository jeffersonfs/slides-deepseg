abstract = {In the Multiterminal Cut problem we are given an edge-weighted graph and a subset of the vertices called terminals, and asked for a minimum weight set of edges that separates each terminal from all the others. When the number k of terminals is two, this is simply the min- cut, max-flow problem, and can be solved in polynomial time. We show that the problem becomes NP-hard as soon as k = 3, but can be solved in polynomial time for planar graphs for any fixed k. The planar problem is NP-hard, however, if k is not fixed. We also describe a simple approximation algorithm for arbitrary graphs that is guaranteed to come within a factor of 2 2/ k of the optimal cut weight.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of interactive multi-label segmentation. We propose a powerful new framework using several color models and texture descriptors, Random Forest likelihood estimation as well as a multi-label Potts-model segmentation. We perform most of the calculations on the GPU and reach runtimes of less than two seconds, allowing for convenient user interaction. Due to the lack of an interactive multi-label segmentation benchmark, we also introduce a large publicly available dataset. We demonstrate the quality of our framework with many examples and experiments using this benchmark dataset.},

abstract = {We propose a method for interactive multilabel segmentation which explicitly takes into account the spatial variation of color distributions. To this end, we estimate a joint distribution over color and spatial location using a generalized Parzen density estimator applied to each user scribble. In this way, we obtain a likelihood for observing certain color values at a spatial coordinate. This likelihood is then incorporated in a Bayesian MAP estimation approach to multiregion segmentation which in turn is optimized using recently developed convex relaxation techniques. These guarantee global optimality for the two-region case (foreground/background) and solutions of bounded optimality for the multiregion case. We show results on the GrabCut benchmark, the recently published Graz benchmark, and on the Berkeley segmentation database which exceed previous approaches such as GrabCut [32], the Random Walker [15], Santner's approach [35], TV-Seg [39], and interactive graph cuts [4] in accuracy. Our results demonstrate that taking into account the spatial variation of color models leads to drastic improvements for interactive image segmentation.},
